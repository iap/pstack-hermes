"""Regression check: a checkout of the package (install clone) must be LF-only, with binaries intact.

Why this exists
---------------
The package contract is LF-only (see ``tools/validate.py::check_encoding``), and
the pstack/ subtree is what ``hermes plugins install
iap/pstack-hermes/pstack`` actually clones. The
``build`` CI job validates the *source* ``pstack/`` directory, where files are LF
because ``tools/convert.py`` wrote them that way. That job is structurally
incapable of catching a line-ending or binary-asset regression introduced by the
publish step, because it never constructs a checkout of the published tree on a
consumer-like configuration.

So this check does the one thing nothing else does: build a throwaway git repo
from a staged dist tree with ``core.autocrlf=true``, the default on Windows, and
assert that what a consumer would receive is byte-correct.

For ``--source-tree`` the staged copy is governed by the repository root
``.gitattributes`` - the rules an install clone actually receives. The legacy
dist rule set lives in ``tools/assets/dist.gitattributes``. ``--package`` may
be used to verify a real checkout.

Exit codes:
  0  every text file checked out LF, every binary byte-identical
  1  a text file is CRLF, or a binary was altered
  2  the input could not be read or git was unavailable
