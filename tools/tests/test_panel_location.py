"""setup-pstack must not write the model panel into the plugin directory.

`hermes plugins update` (and any reinstall) replaces the installed package tree,
so a panel written inside it is silently discarded - the user's model choices
revert to the shipped defaults with no warning. The write target therefore lives
in the hermes config directory, beside `config.yaml`, which survives updates.

The assertions run on the text the converter actually produces, not on the
converter's source: the bug was never in validate.py, it was in the instruction
the skill followed, so asserting on the source would only prove the source says
what the source says. An earlier source-only version of this file passed a
counterfactual that reintroduced the in-package wording - that is how the weakness
was found.

T10_MAP is a local of apply_phase1_transforms(), and driving that function needs a
full converted package plus an upstream clone, neither of which the lint-and-tests
job has. So the map is read out of the module source and applied to a fixture here.
That keeps the assertion on the real transform rather than on prose, and keeps the
test hermetic: no network, no pinned checkout.

The fixture is built from T10_MAP's own anchors rather than hand-typed, because a
hand-typed approximation drifts from upstream and then silently matches nothing -
which is exactly what happened on the first attempt at this file.
