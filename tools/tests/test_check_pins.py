"""check_pins must fail when the pin drifts, is missing, or is malformed.

The gate exists so a bump that misses one of the four workflows cannot reach a
release (the failure mode called out in CONTRIBUTING.md and the re-pin runbook).
These tests pin exactly that property, plus the false-positive case a naive
implementation would hit: a `${{ env.UPSTREAM_PIN }}` reference is not a
declaration and must not be counted.
