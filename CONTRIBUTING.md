# Contributing

Thanks for helping port and maintain pstack on hermes. The repo is small and
the contract is strict — read this once and the CI will never surprise you.

> [!NOTE]
> Coding agents work from [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) (change triage, hermes work
> loop, vocabulary bans). Humans start here. Both describe the same contract;
> that file carries triage and verification orientation; this file carries
> procedures (setup, common tasks, PRs, release).

## Orientation

| Read | For |
|---|---|
| [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) | triage (this repo vs hermes vs upstream), work loop, hermes verify, vocabulary |
| [README.md](README.md) | project identity, install, verification summary, naming table |
| [adaptation register](https://github.com/iap/pstack-hermes/issues/94) | the ledger: every conversion pass and its reviewer check |
| [docs/RUNBOOK-upstream-drift.md](docs/RUNBOOK-upstream-drift.md) | re-pinning procedure when upstream moves |
| [docs/PATCHES.md](docs/PATCHES.md) | historical hermes-fork patches (reference only; not required to install) |

One-sentence model of the repo: **`tools/convert.py` turns a pinned upstream
clone into `pstack/`; `tools/validate.py` and CI keep that output honest;
everything hand-written exists to serve that pipeline.**

## Setup

```sh
uv sync                                   # pinned CPython 3.11 + dev group (pyyaml, pytest, ruff)
uv run --frozen tools/validate.py         # must exit 0 before you start
uv run --frozen pytest -q                 # unit tests for the tooling
uv run --frozen ruff check tools          # lint
```

Python is pinned via `.python-version` and `uv.lock`; never commit interpreter
or dependency drift.

The poteto-mode checker scripts additionally need
[Bun](https://bun.sh) (CI runs the same suite):

```sh
cd pstack/skills/poteto-mode/scripts
bun run test                              # deps + `bun test orch watch-pr`
bun run typecheck                         # deps + tsc --noEmit --strict
```

## The pipeline

1. **Convert** — `tools/convert.py` rebuilds `pstack/` from any pstack clone
   (or a fresh upstream clone at the pinned SHA). Builds are atomic
   (`pstack.tmp-build` swap, with rollback if the swap fails) and
   byte-reproducible under `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`. Every transform anchor in the
   T8/T9/T10/T11/delegation maps is audited: an anchor that matches nothing in
   the upstream build fails the build loudly (upstream drift must be resolved
   by updating or pruning the map, never ignored).
2. **Validate** — `tools/validate.py` runs the four-stage ladder (static →
   repo YAML → gold manifest → gold load). The static stage includes the
   **hermes adaptation contract** (no inert `persona:` blocks, no stale
   runtime claims, no Cursor tool names, no transcript paths, no cloud-worker
   wording, no Cursor-style auto selectors in shipped skills), the
   banned-construct scan, and the model-panel checks (panel == shipped
   `config/models.json`, provider-qualified slugs, per-role value shapes,
   no duplicate concrete slugs inside an array role). The expected skill
   count is **derived from the package**, not hardcoded — structural changes
   flow through automatically. Dependency installs (`node_modules/`) created
   by script verification are exempt from the scans.
3. **Doctor** — `hermes plugins doctor pstack --ci` for install-relevant
   changes (maintainer machine; needs the hermes venv). Select the target
   explicitly — `pstack` is ambiguous: from the repo root it names the local
   directory, elsewhere it can resolve to an installed package. For branch
   verification, pass the resolved local path (`$(pwd)/pstack`); for the
   installed dist package, use the name as installed.
4. **Publish** — pushes to `master` build and validate the append-only
   `dist` compatibility channel. Provenance-only changes do not publish.
   Existing unpinned installs can continue fast-forward updates.
   `master` is the intended default branch; drift schedules, labeler and
   Dependabot run directly there. No default-branch scheduler shim is needed.

## Repository contract

- Target `master` for development PRs. Restore it as the default after this
  migration merges; keep `dist` append-only for installed clones.

- `pstack/` is **generated content** — never hand-edit; change the converter
  and rebuild. Provenance (`.build-provenance.txt`) must record the pinned
  upstream SHA at all times.
- **Banned constructs** are defined once in `tools/bans.py` (6 delegation tokens: `subagent_type`, `generalPurpose`, `AskQuestion`, `` `Task` ``, `run_in_background`, `environment: "cloud"`, plus 3 security needles: `tailscale.com/install.sh`, `FOR_AGENTS.md`, `http://127.0.0.1:4173`) and the hermes adaptation bans in `tools/validate.py`. Enforced by `tools/validate.py` and the CI scanner gate (`tools/scanner_gate.py`). Inline legacy model slugs in skill prose (e.g. a superseded default kept as fallback documentation) are intentional fallback documentation, not banned.
- Encoding: LF-only, no BOM (`.gitattributes` enforces; validate.py fails on
  drift).
- Attribution: upstream MIT (© Lauren Tan) is preserved everywhere; new port
  work is © the pstack-hermes-port contributors.
- Fork patches live in `patches/` with documentation in
  [docs/PATCHES.md](docs/PATCHES.md); the drafted upstream PR text is
  [historical proposal](https://github.com/iap/pstack-hermes/issues/95).

## GitHub Actions & workflow policy

The `.github/` tree is hand-written and gated; these rules exist because each
one has already caught (or would have caught) a real defect here.

- **Every action is pinned to a full commit SHA** with a trailing `# vN`
  comment. `dependabot.yml` keeps them current: the weekly `github-actions`
  group PR updates both the SHA and the comment. Review SHA bumps like any
  dependency change - the usual CI gates run on the PR. The root entry does
  **not** cover `.github/actions/*/action.yml`, so each composite action with
  its own `uses:` needs a directory-scoped entry there.
- **The repository Actions allowlist is closed.** Settings -> Actions permits
  GitHub-owned actions plus the `astral-sh/setup-uv@*` and `oven-sh/setup-bun@*`
  patterns only, with `sha_pinning_required` on and a read-only default
  `GITHUB_TOKEN` (the policy lives in repository settings, not in this tree).
  A new third-party action fails at `Set up job` with "not allowed" until its
  `owner/repo` is added there - deliberately, so introducing an action is a
  decision rather than an accident. Dependabot keeps already-allowed pins
  current as usual.
- **`UPSTREAM_PIN` moves in lock-step.** It is declared in `ci.yml`,
  `release.yml`, `publish-dist.yml` and `upstream-drift-watch.yml`;
  `tools/check_pins.py` fails CI when any of the four is missing, duplicated,
  malformed, or out of step. Follow
  [docs/RUNBOOK-upstream-drift.md](docs/RUNBOOK-upstream-drift.md).
- **Workflows must pass `actionlint`** (with `shellcheck`) - the `Lint
  workflows` CI step, runnable locally as `uv run --frozen actionlint`.
- **Action inputs must be declared by the action they target.** `tools/`
  `check_action_inputs.py` fails on a `with:` key the pinned action does not
  declare - the runner only warns and silently ignores such a key (the
  `syncLabels` / `sync-labels` defect), and actionlint cannot see it because it
  does not read remote action metadata.
- **Composite actions must pass `tools/check_action_shell.py`.** actionlint
  does not lint `.github/actions/*/action.yml` steps, so that file's run
  blocks get their own shellcheck pass in CI. If the gate flags something,
  fix it or add a targeted `# shellcheck disable=` with a comment saying why
  (see `drift-issue-upsert` for the jq `$ENV` case).
- **Reuse: composite action when callers continue afterwards; reusable
  workflow only when the shared thing is a whole job.** Both call sites and
  the rationale are documented in `.github/actions/build-package/action.yml`.
  Shared multi-step logic (build prologue, drift-issue upsert) lives in
  `.github/actions/`, and no workflow re-inlines it.
- **Minimal `permissions:` at workflow level**, widened only per job where a
  step needs it. Checkouts that never push set `persist-credentials: false`.
- **Every job sets `timeout-minutes`.** A hung step otherwise burns the
  6-hour default before anyone notices.
- **`pull_request_target` is allowed only for the labeler**, where no PR
  content is checked out or executed. Never add a PR-head checkout to that
  job; put such work in a `pull_request` workflow instead.

## Common tasks

### Add or change a converter transform

1. Edit the map or pass in `tools/convert.py` (maps like `T8_MAP`,
   `DELEGATION_MAP`; passes register in `st.fixes`).
2. Rebuild: `uv run --frozen tools/convert.py --source <pstack-clone> --out pstack`
   — a dead anchor fails here on purpose.
3. Create an adaptation issue linked to the [preserved register](https://github.com/iap/pstack-hermes/issues/94),
   recording the pass, scope, source of truth and **reviewer check**.
4. If the pass has a checkable scope, add a unit test
   (`tools/tests/test_t11_scope.py` is the pattern).
5. `uv run --frozen tools/validate.py` and the full local suite, then PR with
   the rebuilt tree and `rebuilt from pin <sha>` in the body.

### Re-pin upstream

Follow [docs/RUNBOOK-upstream-drift.md](docs/RUNBOOK-upstream-drift.md)
verbatim. The one rule people forget: `UPSTREAM_PIN` is declared independently
in **four workflows** — `ci.yml`, `release.yml`, `publish-dist.yml`,
`upstream-drift-watch.yml` — and all four must move in the same PR. Update maps,
never the package. (The build prologue itself now lives once, in the
`.github/actions/build-package` composite action, so `ci.yml`, `release.yml` and
`publish-dist.yml` pass the pin to it as an input rather than each repeating
the clone/verify/convert steps. `tools/check_pins.py` now enforces the
lock-step rule in CI, so a missed file fails fast instead of at release time.)

### Change the model panel

Edit `tools/assets/model-panel.json` (never the shipped
`pstack/config/models.json` — Stage-D copies it in and `validate.py` checks
they match). Rebuild, then confirm the weekly
[model-drift-watch](.github/workflows/model-drift-watch.yml) assumptions still
hold: slugs are provider-qualified `vendor/model[:variant]`, array roles hold
no duplicate concrete slugs, and per-role value shapes (string vs array)
match the converter's expectations. Prose-only slug mentions are
informational (`tools/slug_drift.py --prose`).

### Update hermesbot

Edit `tools/assets/hermesbot/SKILL.md` — the shipped
`pstack/skills/hermesbot/` copy is converter output. Rebuild and validate.

### Release

1. Merge the release changes to `master`, including the `CHANGELOG.md`
   section for the `v0.4.x` tooling version. Package version stays upstream's.
2. Wait for `publish-dist` to succeed. Create a `v*` tag on that source commit.
3. `release.yml` rebuilds and validates, checks that the package matches the
<!-- coderabbit-ai-generated:v1 -->

<!-- coderabbit-ai-generated-section:v1:9ad9535da30d31f95f6f7b2099158d95227e5463771f36b895a4222c9dcb07df -->

   published `dist` commit, including provenance except `converted_at`, and
   creates a GitHub Release with ZIP, SHA-256 checksum, source SHA and immutable
   package install command.

<!-- /coderabbit-ai-generated:v1 -->
   A lagging or different dist tree fails release creation; rerun after publish.
4. Close the milestone once all acceptance checks pass. Link issues and PRs
   in release notes. Never move an existing release tag.

### Plan and adaptation tracking

Create issues for proposals, implementation plans and adaptation decisions.
Each includes motivation, scope, acceptance criteria and reviewer checks.
Split independent work into native sub-issues and use milestones for outcomes.
A converter PR links its adaptation issue and includes the generated package;
retain the [existing contracts](https://github.com/iap/pstack-hermes/issues/94).
Do not keep parallel plans or adaptation ledgers in `docs/`.

## Pull requests

The [PR template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) requires: convert clean, validate
exit 0, doctor exit 0 (install-relevant), banned-construct scan, the
poteto-mode Bun suite (`bun run test` / `bun run typecheck`), provenance
consistency. A PR that changes `pstack/` must say `rebuilt from pin <sha>` in its
body and name the converter change behind the rebuild — that tree is build
output, and reviewers read it as output. The [PR template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
carries the matching "Generated package" fields. CI runs all of it plus the pinned-SHA re-check, unit tests, lint,
and a weekly upstream-drift check
([upstream-drift-watch](.github/workflows/upstream-drift-watch.yml)) that opens
a tracking issue when upstream `pstack/` changes past the pin; a weekly
[model-drift-watch](.github/workflows/model-drift-watch.yml) re-verifies every
configured model slug against the provider catalog (`tools/slug_drift.py`).
PRs are
auto-labeled by path (labels are created once via the `labels-bootstrap`
workflow after the repo goes public).

## Issue reports

Use the templates — platform (hermes portable / hermes slash / Cursor
dual-load) and affected skill are required fields; `hermes plugins doctor
pstack --ci` output is the most useful evidence you can attach.

## Document style

GitHub renders **alert callouts** in markdown, so use them in this repo's
hand-written docs (`CONTRIBUTING.md`, `README.md`, `SECURITY.md`, the PR
template, issue bodies). They carry more weight than a plain `> Note.` block.

```
> [!NOTE]
> Required context, or a non-obvious "yes, this is intended".

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A decision or constraint that changes what a correct change looks like.

> [!WARNING]
> Something that will silently break or mislead if skipped.

> [!TIP]
> A shortcut worth knowing, not required for correctness.
```

- One callout per point. Don't stack them; write the prose instead.
- `[!CAUTION]` is for *destructive or irreversible* steps — use it sparingly,
  and only where a reader could actually hit the action.
- Keep the first line short; the body carries the detail. GitHub truncates
  callouts to a preview in some views.

### Where alerts do **not** apply

- **Commit messages.** GitHub does not render markdown (including alerts) in
  commit messages — they stay plain text. Say it in the subject line or the
  body as normal prose. The `type(scope): summary` convention already carries
  the what/why; add a second line for the why if it doesn't fit.
- **The generated `pstack/` package.** That tree is rebuilt by
  `tools/convert.py` from upstream and is never hand-edited. Don't add a
  callout convention there as a hand-edit rule — it would be wiped on the next
  build. If alerts belong in package prose, that's a converter change (and an
  upstream-drift consideration), not a CONTRIBUTING note.
