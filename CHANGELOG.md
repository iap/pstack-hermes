# Changelog

All notable changes to the pstack-hermes port tooling will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.4] - 2026-10-06

### Added
- `tools/check_action_inputs.py` + CI step: fails when a step passes a `with:` key the pinned action does not declare. The runner only warns on such a key (`Unexpected input(s)`) and silently ignores the value - the class behind the `syncLabels` / `sync-labels` defect fixed above. Verified as a genuine gap before adding the gate: with the defect reintroduced, actionlint exits 0 and the full pytest suite passes unchanged. Resolves local actions from disk and pinned remote actions from raw.githubusercontent.com; a fetch failure is a tool error, never a pass. Unit tests inject the fetch, so they run offline; the CI step is the only networked consumer.
- `.github/dependabot.yml`: weekly grouped updates for the `github-actions` ecosystem (updates both the pinned SHA and the `# vN` comment) and for `uv` (pyproject.toml + uv.lock). The repo pins everything; with no update bot the pins silently rot, which was the largest structural gap in the workflow layer.
- `tools/check_pins.py` + CI step: fails when `UPSTREAM_PIN` is missing, duplicated, malformed or out of step across `ci.yml` / `release.yml` / `publish-plugin.yml` / `upstream-drift-watch.yml`. The lock-step rule was documented in two files and enforced by none; this makes it machine-checked and de-risks the re-pin procedure.
- `tools/check_action_shell.py` + CI step: shellchecks every composite action's `run:` blocks. actionlint does not lint `.github/actions/*/action.yml` steps (verified against 1.7.12 by injecting a deliberate shell error), so the shared bash had no static check - a class that had already produced a real bug (see Fixed).
- CI also gains: `concurrency` (superseded PR runs cancel; non-PR runs take a per-run group so every main push keeps its full run - tightened after the review below, see Fixed), `timeout-minutes` on every job, and 14-day retention on the build artifacts.
- `.github/actions/drift-issue-upsert/`: shared composite action for the idempotent issue-by-title upsert both drift watchers need; the two callers' copies had already drifted apart (different jq expressions for the same intent).

### Changed
- **Single-source installs.** The package now installs from this one repository: the built tree is published to its `dist` branch, which is the repository's default branch, so `hermes plugins install iap/pstack-hermes` works root-level and `hermes plugins update pstack` updates natively. The separate dist repo is retired; no second repository is ever published. (A `main`-subdir install of `pstack/` remains as a legacy pinned-style alternative.) `dist` also carries a scheduler stub so the weekly drift watchers keep firing despite the default-branch flip; manual recovery for dispatch-only workflows is `gh workflow run <file> --ref main`.
- **Re-pin to upstream `c47b1284` (pstack v0.15.5); `pstack/` rebuilt.** Every converter anchor was re-anchored or pruned against the new upstream text (36 dead anchors at the new pin -> 0; `T8`-`T14` + delegation), **F16 retired** (upstream now ships the slug-agnostic lane check itself), `reflect`'s 4-column reviewer table adopted with the upstream `budget` key in the setup-written panel shape, and the two new upstream principles ported (`principle-attack-the-premise`, `principle-test-behavior-not-implementation`) - 45 -> 47 skills. Prose model defaults refreshed (`grok-4.7-xhigh-fast`, `claude-opus-5-5-max`); the shipped panel keeps its vendor-qualified verified slugs. `UPSTREAM_PIN` bumped in all four workflows (lock-step enforced by `tools/check_pins.py`); details and the triage correction (no `skills/orchestrate` ever existed) in `docs/ADAPTATIONS.md` section 4.
- Docs / agent policy (Phase A, no package rebuild): `AGENTS.md` and `docs/USING.md` codify the stock-skills write surface — Hermes self-improvement (`skill_manage` / learning) targets local skills, skill taps, or a dist fork, not stock plugin skills. Stack forge freeze: **Graphite (`gt`) default**, **GitHub (`gh`) fallback**, **GitLab (`glab`) halted**. README Known limitations aligned (was incorrectly describing Graphite as optional-only).

### Fixed
- Dev-tree README skill counts corrected: the skills bullet said 45 (24 + 21 `principle-*`) while the generated package README and `.build-provenance.txt` already said 47 (24 + 23) after the v0.15.5 re-pin. Docs-only; `pstack/` untouched (#80).
- Label sync never ran (found while auditing every `with:` key against each action's declared inputs - the only such mismatch in the repo). `labeler.yml` passed `syncLabels: true`, but the input id is `sync-labels`: the runner logs `Unexpected input(s) 'syncLabels'` and the action falls back to its declared default (off), so stale labels were never removed on `synchronize` despite the step comment promising exactly that. Corrected to `sync-labels` (kebab-case; both v5 and the v7 that #69 landed declare it). Evidence: run 37394726141's log records the ignored input verbatim.
- `.github/actions/build-package` was outside dependabot's scan. The root `github-actions` entry covers `.github/workflows` plus a repo-root `action.yml`, not `.github/actions/*/action.yml` - observed when #69's setup-uv bump updated every workflow and skipped the shared action, leaving its pin behind and on a path to silent rot, the exact failure mode `dependabot.yml` exists to prevent (AGENTS.md: pins are "bumped by dependabot, not by hand"). Added a directory-scoped entry (the `actions/github-script` pattern) and caught the pin up to the SHA the workflows now use.
- CI concurrency, from the manual Macroscope review of PR #67: `cancel-in-progress: false` alone did not make the "main runs stay whole" claim true. By default only one run may be *pending* per concurrency group and a newer pending run cancels the older one, so two merges in quick succession could cancel a queued main run before it ever started and the intermediate commit would skip `verify-determinism`. Non-PR runs now take a per-run group (`github.run_id`); semantics verified against GitHub's concurrency documentation.
- Drift watchers (High), from the same review: moving the issue upsert into its own composite step silently dropped its guard. The check step's no-drift `exit 0`s end only that step, so the upsert still ran with `$RUNNER_TEMP/drift-body.md` absent and `gh issue comment/create --body-file` failed - the workflow would fail on the common no-drift path (latent today, because upstream drift keeps the body-writing path active; it would start failing the week after a re-pin). Both watchers now emit `drift=true` from the check step only on the path that also writes the body, and the upsert step is conditioned on it; pinned for both watchers by `tools/tests/test_workflow_review_guards.py`.
- Drift watchers: the "not creating a possible duplicate" guard could never fire. `existing="$(gh ... || lookup_status=$?)"` set the variable inside the subshell, so the parent always saw the initial 0; when `gh issue list` failed, the workflow proceeded with an empty result and CREATED a duplicate tracking issue - the exact failure the guard's message claims to prevent. Reproduced in bash before fixing; shellcheck SC2030/SC2031 flagged it once the shellcheck gate existed. The upsert now lives in the shared `drift-issue-upsert` action with the status captured outside the substitution, and one jq form for both callers.
- Action version pins had drifted between workflows (`actions/checkout` at v4 in the drift watchers vs v7 elsewhere; `astral-sh/setup-uv` v5 vs v10). Unified; dependabot keeps them current from here.
- Model panel no longer written into the plugin directory (#57). `hermes plugins update` replaces the installed package tree, so a `config/models.json` written next to `plugin.json` was silently discarded on every update - the user's per-role model choices reverted to the shipped defaults with no warning. `setup-pstack` now writes `pstack-models.json` in the hermes config directory beside `config.yaml`, which survives reinstalls, and the consuming skills (`why`, `reflect`, `arena`, `interrogate`) read that path while still tolerating a legacy in-package panel so existing customizations are migrated rather than ignored. The shipped default panel stays in the package - only the user override moves.
- `dist_checkout_check`: the gate no longer substitutes its own `.gitattributes` for the tree's, which made it blind to the regression it exists to catch. `stage_tree` copied `tools/assets/dist.gitattributes` over whatever the dist tree actually held, so a published tree missing the rule - the publisher `cp` line deleted, or the rule stale - still validated clean. A staged tree must now carry the rule and match the tested one; the source `pstack/` tree (which legitimately has none, since the publisher adds it) is still allowed. Both refusals are counterfactual-checked: dropping either guard fails a test.
- `dist_checkout_check`: the source-tree exemption is an explicit `--source-tree` flag instead of a directory-name guess. A staged dist checkout is legitimately named `pstack`, so the name-based rule let a published tree with no attributes file at all validate clean - the same blind spot the previous entry closes, reached by another route.
- `dist_checkout_check`: git output is decoded as UTF-8 with `surrogateescape` instead of the ambient locale codec. Under cp1252 a non-ASCII path came back mangled, stopped matching its staged key, and was skipped as "absent" - so its CRLF and byte-identity assertions never ran while the gate reported clean.
- `dist_checkout_check`: a package file git never tracks (typically excluded by a packaged `.gitignore`) is now refused rather than skipped, since it would otherwise never be verified while the gate reported clean.
- `dist_checkout_check`: a git failure now exits 2 as documented instead of propagating a `RuntimeError` traceback at exit 1; a tracked file with no staged counterpart is reported as unverified rather than silently skipped; dead `BINARY_SUFFIXES` is removed; and the shipped `dist.gitattributes` gained its missing trailing newline.
- Reworded the `*.png binary` justification in `publish-plugin.yml`: it claimed `text=auto` would corrupt `assets/logo.png`, but git's own content sniffing already prevents that and only a deliberate `*.png text` rule corrupts it. The line is kept as intent, not as the thing currently doing the work.
- `upstream-drift-watch`: the job now runs at all. Its `gh issue list/comment/create` calls carry no `--repo`, so `gh` resolves the target from the git checkout - and the job had no `actions/checkout`, so every run failed with `failed to run git: fatal: not a git repository`. It has failed this way on every run since 2026-09-14, silently, because the last success was 2026-09-07 when upstream had not yet moved past the pin. The checkout is pinned by SHA with `persist-credentials: false`, matching `model-drift-watch.yml`. Also dropped the blobless `--filter=blob:none` clone (this job needs two commits of `pstack/`; the promisor repo only made the diff depend on network at diff time), and the drift diff exit status is now checked rather than used only as a condition, so a failed diff is reported as one. This is the guard that should have raised #53 (pstack is at v0.15.5 upstream; the pin is still v0.14.8). Only the blobless attempt was verified as usable, so when the shallow fallback also failed, `set -e` aborted at the *fetch* and the run logged two copies of `fatal: not a git repository` with nothing pointing at the real fault. Both attempts are now checked the same way, and a total failure exits with the clone error itself. This job has failed this way on every run since 2026-09-14 — silently, because the last success was 2026-09-07 when upstream had not yet moved past the pin. It is the guard that exists to report upstream drift, and issue #53 is the drift it should have raised (pstack is now at v0.15.5 upstream; the pin is still v0.14.8).

### Added
- `tools/dist_checkout_check.py`: regression check for the property the build gates are structurally unable to see. The `build` job validates the source `pstack/` directory, where files are LF because the converter wrote them that way, so it cannot catch a line-ending or binary-asset regression introduced by the dist publish step. This stages the package the way `publish-plugin.yml` does, clones it with `core.autocrlf=true` (the Windows default, and what `hermes plugins install` does), then asserts every tracked text file checked out LF and every non-text file byte-identical. Wired into the `build` job and re-run against the staged tree in `publish-plugin.yml` before it commits, so a bad tree is never published. The attributes rule moved to `tools/assets/dist.gitattributes`, which the publisher copies verbatim, so the rule and the test that guards it cannot drift apart.

### Fixed
- Coverage gap: the check classified a file as text only when it had a known extension or a listed name, and as binary only when its bytes contained a NUL. This package ships extension-less **text** files (LICENSE and the watch-pr launcher), which matched neither test and were therefore silently skipped - the checker reported a clean tree without ever looking at 2 of 134 files. Text is now the default and binary requires a NUL byte, so the two branches are mutually exclusive and exhaustive and every tracked file is checked.
- Dist repo line endings: `publish-plugin.yml` now writes a `.gitattributes` (`* text=auto eol=lf`, `*.png binary`) into the published `iap/pstack` tree. The dist repo is consumed by `hermes plugins install` as a git clone, so on a consumer with `core.autocrlf=true` (the Windows default) every text file - including the user-editable `config/models.json` - was checked out as CRLF, and `hermes plugins update`'s stash/pull/reapply then rewrote it again, drifting the package away from its own LF-only contract. Measured on a forced checkout with `autocrlf=true`: 38 CRLF before, 0 after, `assets/logo.png` byte-identical either way.
- `test_validate_encoding.py` fixture: wrote the LF-only `SKILL.md` fixture with `write_text`, which translates `\n` to `os.linesep` on Windows, so the assertion failed there for a platform reason rather than a product reason. Now uses `write_bytes` with explicit `\n`. `check_encoding` itself was correct and is unchanged; this only makes the fixture platform-independent. (`lint-and-tests` runs on `ubuntu-latest` only, so the `windows-latest` build matrix never exercised this test.)

## [0.4.3] - 2026-09-18

### Added
- `publish-plugin.yml`: CI publisher that publishes the validated built package to the plugin-only dist repo `iap/pstack` (build output; append-only commits so installed clones can fast-forward — history is never rewritten; skipped with a warning until `PLUGIN_DIST_TOKEN` is configured; every real publish is tagged `pstack-<date>-<sha>`, because the plugin catalog admits only repos with real tags). The dist repo's tree root is the package, enabling the root install shorthand `hermes plugins install iap/pstack --enable` — no subdir — and in-place `hermes plugins update pstack` (root installs keep `.git`; verified against the hermes installer source). Requires the one-time `PLUGIN_DIST_TOKEN` secret (fine-grained PAT, contents: read/write on the dist repo only).
- Agent-facing docs: `AGENTS.md` (harness identity, generated-tree rule, hermes-vs-Cursor vocabulary, primitive mapping) and a CONTRIBUTING rewrite (orientation, Bun setup, common-task recipes, publish stage).
- `docs/USING.md` "Customizing skills": three routes by intent (edit in place for small tweaks, fork the dist repo for owned variants, skill taps for adding new skills alongside) with the keep-hermes-vocabulary warning for end users.
- `validate.check_conflict_markers`: static-stage gate banning unambiguous VCS conflict-marker line-starts package-wide (a bare `=======` stays legal as a setext underline; node_modules exempt), with regression tests.

### Changed
- README install routes reorganized: root install via the dist repo is primary; the `iap/pstack-hermes/pstack` subdir install is documented as the legacy route (still works). Update instructions split by route (in-place update for root installs; reinstall for subdir installs).

### Fixed
- Converter: `T13_MAP`'s frontier-provider entry was anchored on text that only exists *after* the `T13_MAP` forge-wording entry and `T14_MAP`'s first entry run — an ordering that can never match a clean pinned clone (the local 2026-09-14 build predated the map edit and its `pstack/` was stale). Re-anchored the entry to the pinned paragraph, pruned the two subsumed entries (`T13_MAP` forge-wording line, `T14_MAP` first entry — their intent is carried by the full-paragraph provider-selection rewrite), and rebuilt from the clean pin: `orchestrate.md` and the package README now carry the T15 provider-selection wording, with the anchor audit passing against a fresh clone of `93b00b8`.
- T15b robustness (carried through the converter after a direct-to-generated-file edit was caught by the reproducibility gate): GitHub-native discovery now scopes itself to an explicit `--prs` pin instead of validating every PR in the repository as one stack, `gh pr list` passes an explicit `--limit 100` so connected stacks beyond 30 PRs are not silently truncated, and auto-provider fallback is persisted into `frontier.json` as a `fallback` field (which providers were skipped) so a Graphite → GitHub fallback is coordinator-visible instead of silent. The GitLab provider remains reserved ("not implemented yet") pending a reviewed `glab` integration.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-09-13

### Added
- Docs: `docs/ADAPTATIONS.md` (adaptations ledger, primitive mapping, deliberately-not-ported), `docs/RUNBOOK-upstream-drift.md` (re-pin procedure), `docs/USING.md` (invocation model, first run, expectations). Review round: the upstream closure date corrected to 2026-09-10 (closed unmerged; the API attests no closer), and the panel-consumer claim now quotes the actual role-line phrases.
- `slug_drift.py --prose`: scans skill markdown for backtick-quoted model-slug defaults (including vendor/model forms) once the provider catalog loads; `model-drift-watch.yml` passes `--prose` and reports prose-only findings as informational (exit 0) — a catalog tool error (exit 2) skips the scan, since the panel slugs are verified against the loaded catalog first (#25/#29)
- CONTRIBUTING: document the GitHub alert-callout style for docs — and where it does not apply (#30)

### Changed
- Structure hygiene: `pstack/` marked `linguist-generated` in `.gitattributes` (diffs collapse in review) and PR guidance now requires `rebuilt from pin <sha>` in the body; README documents the two version lines (package `0.14.8` vs repo `v0.4.x`) and corrects the transform range to T1–T13; the package README's Known limitations gains the optional-MCP-servers note (template change + rebuild); the PR template gains the matching conditional `pstack/` rebuild-disclosure fields
- Main README rewritten Hermes-first: first-screen unofficial-port identity (not affiliated with Cursor or Lauren Tan; Cursor users go upstream), install up front, Cursor dual-load demoted to a trailing incidental/unsupported note; layout line corrected T1–T11 to T1–T12
- Converter package-README template: `uv run --frozen` regenerate command and a CLI-install section replacing the manual-copy path; T13 gains the missed orchestrate.md `cursor-team-kit` anchor — rebuilt package from pinned `93b00b8` now carries zero `cursor-team-kit` references in shipped skills
- T13 conversion pass: residual Cursor-vendor coupling reworded across the package — `cursor-team-kit` references (a deslop pass, `control-ui`/`control-cli`), the cloud-agent fleet wording, and Graphite (`gt`) phrasing; `T13_MAP` wired into the conversion flow and the anchor audit (115/115)
- PR template: replace the unrunnable `python3 convert.py` checkbox with the real `uv run --frozen tools/convert.py --source <pstack-clone> --out pstack` invocation (the script lives in `tools/` and requires `--source`); add the `tools/scanner_gate.py --package pstack` line that actually enforces the banned-construct checkbox; note the gateway-restart warning in the doctor line as unrelated noise
- SECURITY.md reporting triage: issues caused by this port (adaptations, exclusions, configuration, install) belong to this repository; upstream reports are reserved for genuine platform or original-project defects — including a Hermes defect that surfaces only while a plugin is installed
- Issue chooser: the port-problem link now opens the Bug report form directly (`issues/new?template=bug_report.yml`) instead of the All-issues list

### Fixed
- Residual doc defects: the package README no longer says it rebuilds benny as "hermes cron/loop jobs" (the template is corrected at the source, so the generated line is right by construction), and the control-surface replacement is properly capitalised. The two dead T13 maps — `T13_PRINCIPLE_MAP` and `T13_README_MAP`, both defined but never applied or audited — are removed.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-09-10

### Changed
- T12: Cursor built-in `/loop` and `/goal` references reworded to hermes-native mechanisms — gateway cron jobs as the wake/scheduler (autonomous-run, autopilot-full, autopilot-stack, babysit, bug-fix, multi-phase-plan, shipping, visual-parity) and an armed `goal.md` in the agent store replacing the goal primitive; trigger phrases de-slashed ("loop until X"); plan checker (`check-plan.mjs`) marker aligned to accept the new mechanism

### Removed
- Executed pipeline-hardening plan doc dropped from `docs/superpowers` (#23). The plan shipped in v0.4.0 and the repo's own `.gitignore` already places agent session artifacts (plans/notes) outside the repo.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-09-09

### Fixed
- Delegation phrasing residuals: collapsed doubled `delegate_task` fragments in reflect (reviewers + synthesizer calls), reworded unbackticked Cursor leftovers (poteto-mode "omit Task `model`" -> inherit-parent semantics, how "Task subagent" -> delegate subagent)
- README differences contract: replaced the stale "nothing else modified" claim with the actual pass register (T8/T9/T10, Phase-2A, T11) and a pointer at `.build-provenance.txt` as the authoritative record; documented the `docs/guide/` exclusion; fixed off-by-one cross-reference (see 9 -> see 8)
- Ban-list inconsistency: unified delegation-vocab ban list under `bans.py` (single source of truth, 6 tokens)
- Model-slug drift: weekly CI re-verifies configured slugs against the live OpenRouter catalog
- Panel dedup guard: rejects duplicate provider slugs inside a role array; `inherit-parent` selector exempt
- Empty catalog guard: `slug_drift.py` raises on empty/malformed catalog instead of reporting every slug as missing
- Malformed JSON: local input failures return exit 2 (tool error) instead of crashing with exit 1 (misclassified as drift)
- Issue lookup failure: workflow fails instead of creating duplicate tracking tickets
- Workflow concurrency: overlapping runs are serialized, not cancelled
- Stale version reference: removed "hermes v0.20.5" from README template
- Stale line numbers: removed source line number references that drift across versions
- Roadmap promise: removed "expected in a future release" claim from README template

### Added
- `tools/slug_drift.py` — model-slug drift check against provider catalog
- `.github/workflows/model-drift-watch.yml` — weekly model-slug drift watch
- `## Environment` section in PR template (OS / Shell / Hermes version)
- Update instructions in README (uninstall + reinstall workflow)

### Changed
- convert.py: 4 specific-first `DELEGATION_MAP` pairs + `T9_MAP[19]` anchor updated to the collapsed intermediate text (anchor audit 78 -> 82)
- PR template: replaced hand-enumerated 2-token ban list with reference to `tools/bans.py`
- CONTRIBUTING.md: updated ban-list documentation to reflect 6-token set
- README.md: clarified install command (shorthand form required)

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-09

### Added
- Initial converter/validator tooling
- Atomic builds with rollback
- Fail-loud anchor audit
- Scanner gate with shared banned-construct source of truth
- CI: 2-OS matrix, SHA gates, determinism proof, unit tests, lint
- Weekly upstream-drift watch
