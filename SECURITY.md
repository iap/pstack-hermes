# Security Policy

## Supported versions

The `main` branch is the only supported line. The package is content-only
(markdown skills + config); the tooling (`tools/`) is Python 3.11.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please use **GitHub's private vulnerability reporting** on this repository
(Security tab → Report a vulnerability). Reports stay private until a fix is
ready.

## This is a port — read this before reporting anywhere

`pstack-hermes` is an **unofficial adaptation** of Lauren Tan's Cursor plugin
for the Hermes Agent platform. The skills loaded from this package are **not**
upstream text: they are upstream text plus this project's adaptation passes
(T1–T12) — Cursor-only mechanics reworded to hermes mechanisms, two upstream
containers excluded for install-scanner compliance, and one hermes-native
replacement skill added.

Anything caused by those adaptations — or by how this package is configured,
installed, or enabled — is **this project's responsibility, not upstream's**.
Report it here.

### Adaptations that are by design (not bugs, not upstream problems)

| Observation | Reality |
|---|---|
| `make-bot-ui` and `automations/benny` are missing | Excluded deliberately: their installer / copy-instruction patterns hard-block the community-source install scanner. The make-bot-ui slot is filled by the hermes-native `hermesbot` skill. |
| Skills say `delegate_task`, `clarify`, `session_search`, `hermes cron`, or `goal.md` where Cursor docs say Task / AskQuestion / transcript files / `/loop` / `/goal` | Port adaptation passes (T6–T12). The Cursor originals do not exist on hermes. |
| `config/models.json` panel and `inherit-parent` defaults | Port-local configuration written by `setup-pstack`. A bad or unresolvable model slug here is a local configuration problem. |
| The package no longer matches upstream pstack file-for-file | Expected. See the differences contract in the package README and the machine-generated fix register in `.build-provenance.txt`. |
| Plan-checker marker, ban list, validator, anchor-audit behavior | This repository's own tooling (`tools/`) — report here. |

### Where to report what

| Problem | Report to |
|---|---|
| This package's content, tooling, adaptations, configuration, install steps, or docs | **This repository** — Issues, or private vulnerability reporting for security matters |
| A hermes platform bug that reproduces **with this plugin disabled** (loader, scanner, scheduler, gateway, CLI) | Upstream: <https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent> |
| A bug in the original Cursor plugin that also reproduces **without** this port | Upstream: <https://github.com/cursor/plugins/tree/main/pstack> (MIT © Lauren Tan) |

Do **not** file this port's misadjustments, misconfigurations, or
misinterpretations upstream. If a problem disappears when the plugin is
disabled, it is not an upstream issue. If you are unsure which side owns it,
open an issue here first with the platform, the exact command, and
`hermes plugins doctor <package> --ci` output — triage starts here, and we
will escalate genuine upstream defects with a minimal reproduction.

## Scope notes

- The shipped package (`pstack/`) performs no network calls, no telemetry,
  and no code execution beyond the scripts documented in each skill.
- The install-scanner contract (community-source safety verdict) is enforced
  in CI; the banned-construct list lives in `tools/bans.py` — the single
  source of truth shared by `validate.py` and the CI scanner gate.
