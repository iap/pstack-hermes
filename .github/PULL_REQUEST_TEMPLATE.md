# Pull request

## What changed
<!-- one or two lines: the change, not a narrative -->

## Tracking

<!-- Link the issue, parent/sub-issue and milestone. Converter changes require
     an adaptation issue with scope and reviewer checks. -->

## Affected surface
- [ ] tooling (`tools/`, CI, docs)
- [ ] generated package (`pstack/`) — **requires a rebuild from the current pin**

## Provenance — required if `pstack/` changed
<!-- tools/pr_checklist.py compares source_commit below to the tree's
     .build-provenance.txt. Copy the exact values from your rebuilt package.
     converter is optional; source_commit is the one that must be right. -->
```yaml
source_commit: <40-char SHA from pstack/.build-provenance.txt>
converter: convert.py (sha256[:16]=<first 16 of your convert.py hash>)
```

## Verification
<!-- Paste the command output. A checked box with no output below it is flagged
     by tools/pr_checklist.py. Put each command's output under its own box. -->
- [ ] `uv run --frozen ruff check tools`
      ```
      <output>
      ```
- [ ] `uv run --frozen pytest -q`
      ```
      <output>
      ```
- [ ] package rebuilt from the pin and `git status` shows the intended `pstack/` diff
      ```
      <git status --porcelain output, or "n/a - no pstack/ change">
      ```
- [ ] poteto-mode scripts green, if touched (`bun run test` + `bun run typecheck`)
      ```
      <output, or "n/a">
      ```

## Notes for reviewers
<!-- Anything a reviewer should weigh: trade-offs, skipped boxes and why,
     screenshots, follow-ups. Optional. -->

> [!TIP]
> **Draft-first content:** Prefer writing draft messages/content before publishing to the public git provider. Keep it technical, short, essential — only on-scope context relations. Cross-check and verify for no false positive/negative. If this is an open/draft PR, add a clear note for reviewers here so they can read the context clearly.
